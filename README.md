So I realise that I have not made enough progress to submit a successful project, but life has been a little bit crazy these last weeks. I have done my best since my initial discussion with my mentor when we discussed my ideas and I decided to make a whack-a-mole game but with a retro twist. Above is the original concept as mocked up on Balsamiq.

I got a lot of the functionality working with some pain, but it isn't where I would like it to be. I realise it may be a fail, especially given that I haven't fleshed out the ReadMe properly, however I will try get it all tidied up for the resubmit as I still think the project idea is a fun and worthwhile one.

I didn't get the background music implemented, and want to have a change of background level the higher the score got.
Also still to fix, the fact that the character stays injured after the first punch and then all the characters pop up as injured. Annoying but with time I will fix it.

Sorry it's not further but I had a call with Student Care to chat about some of the problems I've encountered which have cost me time.

Thanks for reading!
